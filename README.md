## SoundCloud pauser

Simple Chrome extension that adds a browser action button to pause/resume the SoundCloud player hidden away in *some* tab, in *some* window..

Only works on *.soundcloud.com pages, not for players embedded elsewhere.

I'm sure the technical implementation could be a lot less complicated, but this is version 0.1.0.
